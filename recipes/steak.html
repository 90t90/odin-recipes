    <h2>Steak with sweet potatoes and brocolli</h2>
    <p>The following is a recipe I have used to make a steak dinner. Although you can make steak with any number of different side dishes, in this recipe
        I have opted for a baked sweet potato, brocolli and capsicum. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 piece of steak, I normally go for the 200g porterhouse steak available at Aldi</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>0.5kg of sweet potato, diced into 3-5cm long sides</li>
        <li>0.2kg of brocolli, chopped</li>
        <li>1 large red capsicum, chopped</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Various spices, I recommend, cajun and morrocan seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn the oven on to 200 degrees celcius.</li>
        <li>Place the sweet potato, brocolli, and capsicum into an over proof dish, and cover with spices and olive oil.        </li>
        <li>Once oven is at temperature put the vegetables in for approximately 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Chop the onion and cook in olive oil in a skillet on low heat until onion appears glassy.       </li>
        <li>Crush the garlic cloves and add to the onion. Feel free to add some more spices at this step, I can recommend paprika, italian mixed herbs, cajun spices, moroccan seasoning etc...</li>
        <li>Remove the onions and garlic from the frying pan after 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to medium and put the steak in the frying pan. Leave for approximately 3 minutes per side, or until cooked as preferred.</li>
        <li>Serve with the baked vegetables and fried onions.</li>
    </ol>
