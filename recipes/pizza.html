    <h2>Homemade pizza recipe</h2>
    <p>The following is a recipe I've used to make pizza at home. It's a pretty simple
        recipe, and although it isn't going to win any prizes, its a good option for 
        when you need a quick dinner.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flat bread, like used for wraps</li>
        <li>Tomato based pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>200g salami</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of olives, cut in half, pips removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn the oven on to 200 degrees celcius</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce over the flat bread. I like to just use a
            spoon to get a roughly even spread.
        </li>
        <li>Grate the cheese and use it to cover the part of the base with pizza sauce on it</li>
        <li>Cover the pizza with the salami and olives</li>
        <li>Place the pizza in the oven for 15 minutes. Then remove and allow it to
            cool for 5 minutes before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
